# Here is where we set the routing, based on pattern matching on "Path".
# Note: Spring Cloud Gateway is aware of Eureka, and for routing we just need
# to specify the application name (ie the "spring.application.name"
# registered on Eureka, which is "service" from the service module
# in this case), and so would do automatically load balancing.
# However, the application "frontend" is not registered on Eureka,
# so need to provide an explicit URL for it.
